## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned



```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: #D5E3ED;
}
```


### Continued development

I will still want to know more about the usage of FLEX and improve on my CSS
